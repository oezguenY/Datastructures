// MARK: - STACKS

// A LIFO data structure. The last element added to the stack will be the first element
// removed from the stack

// stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like
// undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward)

// WE DO THAT WITH PUSH AND POP (INSERTING AND REMOVING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE LIST)

// use PUSH and POP

// MARK: - BIG O OF STACKS
/*
 Insertion O(1)
 Removal O(1)
 Searching O(N)
 Access O(N)
