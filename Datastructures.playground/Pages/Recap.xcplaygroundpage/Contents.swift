/*
 
 Trees are non linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes
 Binary Trees can have values of any type, but at most two children for each parent
 Binary Search Trees are a more specific version of Binary Trees where every node to the left
 of a parent is less than it's value and every node to the right is greater
 We can search through Trees using BFS and DFS
